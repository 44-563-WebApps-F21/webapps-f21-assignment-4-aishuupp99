            <h2>Conversation between two people about their regrets to knowing her wife</h2>

        <h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">I am sorry now I did not tell my wife the whole thing
at once.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5> <p class="speech">I regret my bad actions.  You regret your good ones—that
is the difference between us.</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">I don’t trust you.  I _will_ tell my wife.  It’s better
for her to know, and from me.  It will cause her infinite pain—it will
humiliate her terribly, but it’s right that she should know.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>  <p class="speech">You propose to tell her?</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">I am going to tell her.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Going up to him_.]</p>  <p class="speech">If you do, I will make my name so
infamous that it will mar every moment of her life.  It will ruin her,
and make her wretched.  If you dare to tell her, there is no depth of
degradation I will not sink to, no pit of shame I will not enter.  You
shall not tell her—I forbid you.</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Why?</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>  <p class="stage-direction">[_After a pause_.]</p>  <p class="speech">If I said to you that I cared for her,
perhaps loved her even—you would sneer at me, wouldn’t you?</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">I should feel it was not true.  A mother’s love means
devotion, unselfishness, sacrifice.  What could you know of such things?
LORD WINDERMERE.  I should feel it was not true.  A mother’s love means
devotion, unselfishness, sacrifice.  What could you know of such things?</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>  <p class="speech">You are right.  What could I know of such things?  Don’t
let us talk any more about it—as for telling my daughter who I am, that I
do not allow.  It is my secret, it is not yours.  If I make up my mind to
tell her, and I think I will, I shall tell her before I leave the
house—if not, I shall never tell her.</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Angrily_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Then let me beg of you to leave our house
at once.  I will make your excuses to Margaret.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS.ERLYNNE.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._  _She goes over to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _with the
photograph in her hand_.  LORD WINDERMERE _moves to back of sofa_, _and
anxiously watches_ MRS. ERLYNNE _as the scene progresses_.]</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">I am so sorry, Mrs. Erlynne, to have kept you waiting.
I couldn’t find the photograph anywhere.  At last I discovered it in my
husband’s dressing-room—he had stolen it.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Takes the photograph from her and looks at it_.]  I am
not surprised—it is charming.</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Goes over to sofa with_ LADY WINDERMERE,
_and sits down beside her_.  _Looks again at the photograph_.]</p> <p class="speech"> And so
that is your little boy!  What is he called?</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Gerard, after my dear father.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">[_Laying the photograph down_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Really?</p><br>

<h5 class="LORD WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Yes.  If it had been a girl, I would have called it
after my mother.  My mother had the same name as myself, Margaret.</p><br>

<h5 class="MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>  <p class="speech">My name is Margaret too.</p><br>
